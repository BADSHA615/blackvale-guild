              AUTH FIXES COMPLETE - TESTING CHECKLIST
================================================================================

WHAT WAS FIXED:
================================================================================
✅ Fixed API Base URL - Now uses environment variable (REACT_APP_API_URL)
✅ Fixed Token Storage - Token is now properly saved to localStorage
✅ Fixed Production URL - Updated .env.production with correct backend URL
✅ Fixed React Hooks - SquadManagement.js useEffect dependencies fixed

YOUR CURRENT SETUP:
================================================================================
Frontend API URL (Local): http://localhost:5000
Frontend API URL (Production): https://blackvale-backend.onrender.com
Backend URL: https://blackvale-backend.onrender.com

TESTING LOGIN & REGISTER:
================================================================================

TEST 1: Local Testing (if running locally)
-------
1. Open terminal in your project folder
2. Start backend: cd backend && npm run dev
3. Start frontend: cd frontend && npm start
4. Go to http://localhost:3000
5. Click "Register"
6. Fill in:
   - Username: testuser
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Game ID: 12345678
   - Password: password123
7. Click "Register"
8. Should redirect to Dashboard and show "Logout" button
9. Click "Logout"
10. Click "Login"
11. Fill in:
    - Email: test@example.com
    - Password: password123
12. Click "Login"
13. Should redirect to Dashboard

TEST 2: Production Testing (Netlify)
------
1. Wait for Netlify build to complete (check GitHub push)
2. Go to your Netlify URL: https://blackvale.netlify.app
3. Click "Register"
4. Fill in test account:
   - Username: produser123
   - Email: prod@test.com
   - Game ID: 87654321
   - Password: password123
5. Click "Register"
6. Should redirect to Dashboard
7. Look for "Logout" button in navbar
8. If you see it, login is working!

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
================================================================================
✅ Register button works
✅ Form submits without errors
✅ Redirects to Dashboard after registration
✅ "Logout" button appears in navbar
✅ Login form works
✅ Can log in with registered account
✅ Token is stored (check browser DevTools > Application > Local Storage)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================================================================================

If you get "Cannot POST /api/auth/register":
  → Backend is not running
  → Fix: Make sure Render backend is deployed and running
  → Check: https://dashboard.render.com

If you get "Failed to fetch":
  → API URL is incorrect
  → Fix: Check REACT_APP_API_URL environment variable
  → For local: should be http://localhost:5000
  → For production: should be https://blackvale-backend.onrender.com

If login works but token not saved:
  → localStorage might be disabled
  → Check: Browser DevTools > Application > Local Storage
  → You should see "token" and "userId" keys

If page doesn't redirect after login:
  → Check browser console (F12) for errors
  → Check Network tab to see if API response is successful

DATABASE ISSUES:
================================================================================
If you get "User already exists":
  → Username or email already registered
  → Use different email/username

If you get "MongoDB connection failed":
  → MongoDB is not running
  → Fix: Check MongoDB Atlas is set up correctly
  → Check: Network whitelist is 0.0.0.0/0

If registration works but login fails:
  → Password not hashing correctly
  → Check: User model has bcrypt password hashing
  → Verify: Password is at least 6 characters

NEXT STEPS:
================================================================================
1. ✅ Fix pushed to GitHub (DONE)
2. Wait for Netlify rebuild
3. Test register/login on Netlify
4. Once auth works, test other features:
   - Create squad
   - Upload screenshot
   - View leaderboard
5. If everything works, you're LIVE!

DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
================================================================================
Backend (Render):    https://blackvale-backend.onrender.com
Frontend (Netlify):  https://blackvale.netlify.app
GitHub Repo:         https://github.com/BADSHA615/blackvale-guild

All changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub.
Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy.

================================================================================
                    Test the app and let me know if it works!
